If something is ordered to be destructed:
- It ONLY disappears immediately if it is a bluePrint
- Otherwise make destruct job
  - Is the health what we chip away at?
- BUT: How to only target at things that can be destructed?
  - Options:
    - Everything except creature-component entities
    - Entities with X component. WHAT IS IT?
      - canBeDestructed ?


When constructing, is it constructprogress we increase, or health?
- Once finished constructing we delete bluePrint component
